Data origins:
-------------

The data used in this project was sourced from 'Our World In Data' (https://ourworldindata.org/time-use), 
and was originally collected by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 
an inter-governmental economic organisation.

Participants completed time-use diaries recording their sequence of activity during 24 hours, 
alongside specific questionnaires where respondents recalled the proportion of time spent in a specific 
activity category (information on the questions asked are not detailed in the original data). 


Paricipants were aged between 15-64.
